1st Part:
    Assume a seat reservation system.
    The theater has 10 rows of 10 seats. A system needs to be developed (without DB):
   1. Load the "Map" of the rows and seats.
X: Occupied Seats.
L: Free seats. By default all seats.

   2. Manage seat reservations considering that a seat can only be reserved if it is FREE.
If it is not FREE, the buyer must be allowed to choose another seat. If it is free, it must go to BUSY.

   3. To finish the program, a particular value must be entered.
Keep in mind that there is no exact number of times it will be executed.

   4. Consider that there are only 10 rows and 10 seats.
You cannot "Oversell"

Considerations> A GUI or DB is not needed.
Logical evaluation.

Extra: Show free seats without GUI. Logic and output through a single console.
